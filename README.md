# L9-sims
Sims for Pluto of all sorts and sizes
Openrocket sim is with .eng files needed, named accordingly. Note the NOx, N and fuel tanks are modelled as engines with only wet mass and close to 0 thrust. Dry mass accounted for using mass object in OPenrocket. Also note that OPenrocket does not model supersonic fin designs.
RASAERO sim accepts only one thrust curve, so this is of all liquid mass and thrust of engine. Total mass accounted for within program. Does model supersonic fins
Rocketpy currently uses same .ENG files as openrocket, with drag curve exported from openrocket. Improvement on this in progress
